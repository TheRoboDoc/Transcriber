# Transcriber

Transcriber is a small program to transcribe all the given audio files in a folder to text using [OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper)

## Install
Download [**Transcriber.zip**](https://github.com/TheRoboDoc/Transcriber/releases/download/v1.0.1.2/Transcriber.zip) -> unzip -> run setup.exe

## How to use
You will need a valid OpenAI API key. A guide for that can be found [**here**](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/).
But in a nutshell, you need to have an OpenAI account. After that head to your API key section and generate one.
**DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE** as they can make requests in your stead and you will end up paying the bill
